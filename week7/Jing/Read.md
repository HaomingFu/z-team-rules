## Foucus of this week

### Binary search tree and dynamic programming, possibly a little graph

- tree traveral methods: preorder, in-order and postorder
- travere without recursion and constant space... on going
- dynamic programming
- sudoku and n queens problem

### Learn more Java
- read head first Java
- learn more about design pattern

### Problems solved

- preorder traversal: easy
- postorder traversal: easy
- longest consecutive sequence: used a set
- edit distance: not very easy if not familiar with DP. But it's a basic problem in DP

### Reading
- Graphs in Python: use dictionary and list: https://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/
- An implementation of dijkstra's algorithm in Python
